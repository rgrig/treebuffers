# Tree Buffers

This code was used to perform the experiments in
  [Grigore, Kiefer, *Tree Buffers*, 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04757).
Run `./reproduce-cav2015.py`, wait a few weeks, then look in the directory `plots/`.
If anything would go wrong, you might need to start over.
Alternatively, say `make`, run `ledit ./main`, type `help`, and explore.

If you want to see the implementation, start with the file `treebuffer.h`.
